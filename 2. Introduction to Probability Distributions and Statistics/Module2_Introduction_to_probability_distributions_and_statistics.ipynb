    "  * Location is determined by mean(<span>&#956;</span>) and shape is determined by standard deviation(<span>&#963;</span>).  \n",
    "  <img src=https://images.slideplayer.com/15/4507977/slides/slide_8.jpg width=\"400\">\n",
    "  * The variable can take any real number between - <span>&#8734;</span> to + <span>&#8734;</span>.\n",

    "  * __Skewness:__ It measures symmetry of a distribution. It is equal to 0 for a normal distribution. Any value other than 0 will represent non-normality. Skewness with negative value indicates data is skewed to the left. Positive values for skewness indicate that the data are skewed right.  \n",
    "  * __Kurtosis:__ Kurtosis measures flatness of the probability distributions of real valued random variable. It measures the amount of probability in the tails. The value is often compared to the curtosis of the normal distribution, which is equal to 3.  \n",
    "  * __Central limit theorem :__ Sample mean and sample standard deviation can be used as the representative values for population mean and population standard deviation.  \n",
    "  * __Law of large number :__ The distribution of any variable can be approximated to a normal distribution as the sample size increases no matter what the shape of the population distribution. Generally, we prefer sample size greater than 30.\n",
